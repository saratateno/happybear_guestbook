# Happy Guestbook
### For Happy Bear Software

This is a response to a tech test for Happy Bear Software designed to meet the following user stories:

```
As a reviewer
So that I can let others know what I think
I want to add a new entry to the guestbook

As a reviewer
So that I can leave my message quickly
I want the entry form to be at the top of the page

As a reviewer
So that the guestbook only contains useful entries
I want to be alerted if I have missed out my name or message

As a reviewer
So that I know whether my entry has been accepted
I want to see a success notification

As someone who has successfully submitted a review
So that I don't have to navigate
I want to be automatically directed back to the entries list

As a visitor
So that I can see what others have said
I want to view all other guestbook entries made so far

As a visitor
So that I know whether a message is relevant
I want to see how old it is and who said it

As a visitor
So that I can see the most relevant messages first
I want them to be ordered by the most recent

As a visitor
So that I can erase mistakes
I want to delete entries in the guestbook

As someone who has clicked delete
So that I know whether the deletion was successful
I want to see a message that the entry was deleted

```

Notes:
* Turbolinks is switched off for this app
* FactoryGirl mocks database entries in testing, with data generated by Faker
* The database system is Postgres
* If either name or message are left blank when creating a new guestbook entry, the form prevents a submission as it is `required` by the HTML form. However, there are also validations at database level to prevent an invalid entry being saved, together with an alert displayed.
